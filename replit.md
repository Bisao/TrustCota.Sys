## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a modern component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design patterns
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for robust form management
- **Authentication**: Context-based authentication system with protected routes

The application uses a responsive design pattern with dedicated mobile navigation and desktop sidebar layouts. Components are organized by feature domains (dashboard, requisitions, suppliers, quotes) with shared UI components in a centralized library.

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a RESTful API design with Express.js:

- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js web framework
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store
- **API Structure**: Resource-based endpoints organized by entity types
- **Middleware**: Custom logging, error handling, and authentication middleware

The server implements a layered architecture with separate modules for authentication, database connections, routing, and storage operations.

### Database Design

The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with the following core entities:

- **Users**: Authentication and role-based access control
- **Suppliers**: Vendor management with ratings and performance tracking
- **Requisitions**: Purchase requests with approval workflows
- **Quotes**: Supplier proposals and pricing information
- **Purchase Orders**: Formal purchasing documents
- **Activities**: Audit trail and activity logging

Database schema is managed through Drizzle ORM with type-safe migrations and relationship definitions.

### Authentication & Authorization

The authentication system implements:

- **Local Authentication**: Username/password authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: Server-side sessions stored in PostgreSQL
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (user, approver, admin) with different permission levels
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection with authentication context

### Component Architecture

The UI follows a consistent design system with:

- **Layout Components**: Header, sidebar, and mobile navigation for consistent app structure
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components for each business area
- **Form Components**: Reusable form components with validation
- **Dashboard Components**: KPI cards, charts, and data visualization widgets

### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through:

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard CRUD operations for all entities
- **Query Client**: TanStack Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly notifications
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators and skeleton screens

## External Dependencies

### Database & ORM
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for data persistence
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting solution

### Frontend Libraries
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built accessible UI components
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI primitives for complex components
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and data synchronization
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management and validation
- **Zod**: Schema validation and type inference

### Authentication & Security
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware and strategies
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store for Express

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool and bundler
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking and enhanced developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

### UI & Styling
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive design utilities
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theming support

The application is designed to be deployed on platforms that support Node.js applications with PostgreSQL databases, with environment-based configuration for different deployment stages.
